## v.2 (November 19th, 2022) MAJOR update
### New features:
- Search on page, highlighting matches (replace Ctrl+f native feature of Chrome, but introduce this feature lacking in Desktop version of Roam).
- Find & Replace: possibiliy to replace matches one by one or replace all
- Block <=> Page converter
- Change format in bulk: header, align, view and case.
- Highlight extraction
- 3 ways to see or backup the results of a search (on page or in graph): in plain text, in clipboard as block references or in the sidebar (in a dedicated page)

### Enhancements:
- Cleaner and (hopefully) better UI, with option to choose where is displayed the dialog box.
- Find & Replace: checkbox to match only words, to auto-expand collapsed blocks and to apply to workspace (linked references + sidebar)
- Better support of advanced usage of regular expressions, now you can extract capture groups. Examples provider in help panel are more useful.
- Auto-detect if blocks are selected (limited range) or not (range = whole page), when opening Find and Replace box.

# Settings change:
- The option to include block references or not in Find & Research has been removed, since you can now choose to replace matches one by one.
